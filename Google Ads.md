# **What is Google Ads?**

Google Ads is Google's advertising system in which advertisers bid on certain keywords in order for their clickable ads to appear in Google search results. One important thing that have to be understood when you bid on a keyword, you are essentially entering an auction and competing against other advertisers who are bidding on the same keyword.You only pay Google when someone clicks your ad, so you can essentially get an ad up and running for free without ever spending a penny. Google has 75% market share, meaning that they are the dominant search engine in the world. Whenever someone wants to find out information, a product or service, 75% of the time they will turn to Google.

There are 3.5 billion searches every single day, which just confirms that people go to Google. Even Though Amazon is indeed growing in search for products, Google is still the king by far. 71% of Google's revenue comes from Google Ads. In 2017, Google made  billions of dollars from ads. This is because 45.5% of users do not know the difference between an ad and an organic result. So just under half of the people carrying out a search don't know the difference between organic and an ad, this  shows how powerful Google Ads are.  

# **Search Network Vs Display Network**

Google Ads appear in two main areas. These are called search networks, and display networks .

**Search Network** Is A group of search-related websites where your ads and free product listings can appear. When you advertise on the Search Network, your ad can show next to search results. Google Search Network is extremely powerful and allows you to target the people who are looking for your products and your services. Because the ad depends on the specific keyword that matches your product or services. For example if you type “online bootcamp” you see websites that have business related to the keyword i have searched before.  And the other reason which makes search networks become powerful is over 75% of users did not know the difference between the ads and the organic search. They simply click what they got from the top,  therefore this helps to boost your business. This search network is the recommended one in google advertisements.

**Display Network** This is one type of google advertisement in which websites display their products to external websites that are not google’s . You would show your ads on these websites in a display form. Display form meaning either a banner or an image.

Therefore with display ads, you don't have the opportunity to target a specific group of people. Your ad is literally shown to everyone who's on that website. So if your business is on Technology and you want to advertise your product into the other external website since it is displayed for the entire user of that website even for someone who searches for politics , due to this it is unable to target the target audience . So as a result, ads run on the Display Network are usually a lot lower in comparison to ads run on Google Search Network.

# **Google Account Hierarchy**

Google Ads is organized into three layers: account, campaigns, and ad groups.  When we look from top down ,you're going to have your Google Ads account. Within your Google Ads account, you're going to have campaigns, and then within your campaigns, you're going to have multiple ad groups. You can have one ad group, you can have five, you can even have a hundred different ad groups. It's completely up to you. And then within each ad group, you're going to have keywords and your actual ad.

![](images/google%20ads/Aspose.Words.cfbe7e08-c68d-4c7c-a31e-21c70bb6c5e2.001.jpeg)

At the top ( Account) level, you have all the options, like setting your email, your time zone, your billing, adding more users, and at **Campaign** level you have all the options like location targeting, so you can determine the  location you want to target with your ads, you have your ad schedule, device targeting and so on. And at ad group level, you have the ad rotation.

# **Location Targeting**

Google Ads location targeting allows your ads to appear in the geographic locations that you choose: countries, areas within a country, a radius around a location, or location groups, which can include places of interest, your business locations, or tiered demographics. If you have a business in Ethiopia and you target all of Ethiopia, then you may select Ethiopia. And that way your ads will only show to people who are based in Ethiopia. If you want to widen the scope of your website visibility it depends on your choice.

**NB**  if you increase the visibility of your website a lot of people can potentially see your ads this makes your business and brands visible wide, but it is going to generate more clicks and it is going to cost you a lot more money. Therefore you have to put it in consideration.

It is recommended to start off by targeting a single city. If your business is a local business, then you target your local city. And even you can target a more detailed location in the radius base from where your local business is running. So you can really get as specific as you want and have full control over the people who are seeing your ads. 

If you have a small business and it is running on a tight budget, then this is a great strategy you can leverage as what you can do is put a five-mile, 10-mile radius, whatever radius you deem to be relevant around your specific business.

# **Budgets** 

How much money we want to spend every day running our Google ads, so it should be the average amount you'd be comfortable spending per day. Your actual costs may be lower, depending on how you manage your bids. You can also set a maximum cost per click as well.

# **Keywords And Their Intents In Google ads**

A keyword is simply a search phrase that you wish to bid on in a Google ad. Every time you bid on a keyword, you are essentially entering an auction and competing against other advertisers.To be successful in google ads, you need to figure out exactly what your potential customers would search for in Google to find your website, the service, or the products that you offer. Each keyword has its own intent.[keyword intent](https://www.wordstream.com/keyword-intent) In addition the intent of the keywords you have to consider about the keyword type is it short-tail or long tail-keyword. Short-tail keywords are much more general search queries consisting of one or two words, while long-tail keywords consist of two to five or even more words.

long-tail keywords are a lot better than short-tail keywords, and the main reason why is because they are more specific, so the customer knows exactly what they're looking for.

# **Keyword Match Type  And Search Terms**

Keyword match types, also known as Google Ads match types, determine how closely a keyword needs to match a user’s search query for an ad to be considered for the auction. In other words, keyword match types give you more control over which keywords trigger your ads to appear in search results. Keyword match types are probably the most important element when it comes to keyword research. So keyword match types apply to the keywords that you add in your Google Ads account. There are different types of keyword match types commonly used such as;

- **Broad match keywords** Broad match keywords are the ones that enable you to reach the widest audience possible, letting you drive a larger volume of traffic to your website. Broad match is the default match type used by Google Ads.
- **Broad match modifier** the symbol for this type is a plus sign. So if you want to add a broad match modifier keyword in your Google Ads account, all you need to do is add a plus sign at the front of each word.
- **Phrase match keywords** Phrase match keywords lie somewhere in between: they are more focused than broad match keywords but less so than exact ones. This does provide you with greater flexibility in terms of getting visitors to your website.and phrases match keywords, additional words can be added either before or after, but not in the middle of the key phrase.
- **Exact match keywords** Exact match keywords are the diametric opposite of broad keywords. As the name clearly states, these keywords are based on exact search queries and terms, down (or almost) to the last detail. This makes this the most difficult of all types of keyword matches to conquer. However, the traffic you generate through exact match keywords is curated and easier to convert for you.

# **Negative Keywords And Their Benefits**

Negative keywords prevent your ad from being triggered by a certain word or phrase. Negative keywords can save you so much money when used correctly. For example, if you only sell luxury products, then you can actually go into your Google ads account and put the word "cheap" as a negative keyword, so whenever someone goes onto Google and searches for something similar to your product and they use the word cheap, Google will ensure your ad does not show to that user, which means straight away, you can block out clicks from people who are looking for a product which you may not offer.

The symbol we use for a negative keyword is the minus symbol. So this would be the symbol you add before the keyword. It can get a bit confusing as you can have different match types for each negative keyword. You could have a broad match negative keyword, you could have a phrase match negative keyword, and you can have an exact match negative keyword as well.

Broad match Negative keywords block out a lot of these keywords. For example, all of these keywords here start the same, "Can you," so the main word we're going to want to block out to block out all of these keywords is going to be the word "can." The reason why is when someone goes onto Google and they type in the word "can," it typically leads to a question. Now, we need to ask ourselves, "Do we want to be showing our ad to users who are going onto Google to type in a question?" The answer is no. The reason being is because these types of people have a low buyer intent.

# **Practices For Writing Killer Ads Text**

Ecommerce & advertising keep evolving, but the cornerstone of writing killer text doesn’t change. If you want to sell more, earn more sign-ups to your newsletter, or broaden your audience, you need ad text that sparks action.

A great technique you can use when creating your Google Ad is going to be highlighting what makes your company unique, or at least comes across as unique is going to help you a lot when it comes to generating more clicks on your ads. Another good strategy you can utilize is to focus on the benefits and not the features.Your customers likely have some type of pain point they’re trying to address by purchasing your product. If you sell comfortable shoes for travelers, create an ad copy that addresses the kinds of aches & pains they likely deal with due to poor footwear.

# **Bidding strategy** 

A bidding strategy is a strategy you allow Google to have when it comes to showing your ads to users.

There are three main types of bidding strategies(but it doesn’t mean the bidding strategies are only three). The first one is **automated bidding** ,in this type of bidding google does everything. The second one is **,** in this bidding strategy you have a lot of control but you let google, but you allow the google’s algorithm to do a bit of work as well. The third one is **manual bidding,** it is the type of strategy where you have complete control and make all of the decisions.

It is highly recommended that you start off with using a manual bidding strategy, and then as you get more data in your Google Ads account, you switch to a specific type of automated bidding strategy where you focus on a goal such as conversions or return on ad spend and so on.

# **Target CPA**

Target CPA bidding is a Smart Bidding strategy that sets bids for you to get as many conversions (customer actions) as possible. When you create the Target CPA (target cost-per-acquisition) bid strategy, you set an average cost you'd like to pay for each conversion. When a customer does a Google search that fits your product or service, Google Ads uses your Target CPA to set a bid based on the auction's likelihood to convert.

Target CPA is a fully automated bid strategy where advertisers set a target cost per conversion, and then Google adjusts their bids to generate as many conversions as possible at that CPA. The cost per click does not matter with this strategy, the main goal is to generate conversions. 

**NB**  The main objective of Target CPA is getting as many conversions as possible for target     cost per acquisition.

# **Manual CPC And Enhanced CPC**

**Manual bidding** is the easiest bid strategy in which  Advertisers set their bids manually at the keyword level, and the bid stays the same until the advertisers change them. The main objective of manual CPC is to fully maintain control over your bids in every single auction. You're willing to pay what you're willing to pay. And that is the end of it. If you set your manual cost per click at $2, then you will never pay anything more than $2.

The main problem of  manual bidding strategy is that you have to do everything by yourself. So, this is the only bidding strategy which has no automation in it, whatsoever. Google has zero influence at all on what it changes and what optimizations are made. It all comes down to you reviewing the data and then making the decisions yourself. You can change the bidding strategy whenever you want. Manual cost-per-click does not require conversion tracking.

**Enhanced CPC:** This is the middle ground between a manual and automatic bidding strategy, as it has components of both. Enhanced CPC bidding is when the advertiser manually establishes Maximum CPC bid amounts but then allows Google Ads’s algorithm to make adjustments based on the likelihood of a click leading to a sale.

# **Quality Score**

Before Quality score was introduced websites were ranked based on the amount of money they pay-per-click. During that time as long as your pockets were deep enough, you could appear on the first page even if with highly irrelevant ads. For instance there are three people , Abel,Kebed and  Almaz and they try to advertise their website to google. If Abel pays $5 per-click,Kebede pays $10 per-click and Almaz pays $2 per-click there is no doubt the one who has the highest amount of pay-per-click will become the first in google search. In our example Kebede has the highest pay-per-click therefore he ranked first. But nowadays this way of ranking is changed because of Quality score.

Quality Score is a rating given by google to the ads based on the keywords of every campaign. It is used to measure and diagnose the overall performance of your pay-per-click(PPC) ads. A high score indicates that your ads are super relevant to users that are searching for related terms in the search engine and that they perform better than the competition. Therefore it has a chance to become the first in google search. Let’s see components of Quality Score and how Quality score works.

# **Components of Quality Score**

There are different components which make up the quality score number. Such as :-

- **Click Through Rate(CTR**): The likelihood that your ad will be clicked when shown. Is the percentage of people that click your ad after seeing it.CTR is calculated 
  - Click Through Rate(CTR) = ( your clicks/your impression on the search)x100. E.g if your ad is shown 10 times and out of those 10 times, it generates one click.  CTR = (1/10)x100 = 10%
  - The more you have Clicks Through Rate(CTR) the higher quality score you have, this is the good signal for google that your ad must be relevant. That is because when people click your ads google makes money.
- **Ad Relevance :** Ad relevance describes How closely your ad matches the intent behind a user's search. relevancy between the keyword you are targeting and your ad text is super important. This  simply means your ad text must be relevant to the keyword you are bidding on.One thing you should bear in mind is that you want to avoid keyword stuffing. So to avoid keyword stuffing, it is good practice to try and include the main keywords in your headlines.
- **Keyword To Query Relevance:** The sentence phrase or question a user types into Google search box is referred to as a query. So whereas your keywords trigger ad impressions, user queries trigger results pages also called SERP. One of the factors that go into your overall time and quality score is the relevance between the user's query and your keyword that triggered your ad impression.
  - Google understands that the more relevant a searcher's query is to an advertiser keyword and ad text, the more relevant and useful that overall user experience is likely going to be.
- **Landing Page Quality:** Landing page relevance is the least weighted factor, but it still plays a big role in determining your quality score.
  - Your landing page needs to be relevant to the keyword you are  targeting . 
    - E.g  if someone clicks on your ad after searching for “Online Training” units, they should land on a page which is relevant to “Online Training” . They should not land on a page where it talks about politics or else.

![](images/google%20ads/Aspose.Words.cfbe7e08-c68d-4c7c-a31e-21c70bb6c5e2.002.png)

From the above pie chart we can see CTR has roughly a 65% weight in regards to quality score. So that is how important your CTR is when determining your quality score.  CTR is composed of your ad to keyword CTR history, your account CTR history, even your geographical CTR history as well. CTRs can vary greatly from one country to another, even from city to city.

Relevancy has roughly 25% weight when it comes to quality score. Your relevancy is made up of things such as your keyword to ad relevance, your keyword to query relevance, your keyword to ad copy, and landing page relevance.

landing page quality accounts roughly 10%. So your landing page quality is mainly going to be things such as, does your landing page meet what your ad text says? Does it meet what the keyword sets and does it follow the right customer flow? And on top of that as well, you need to have a load fast on the landing page and ensure it's easy to navigate around, especially on mobile devices.

# **Ad Rank**

Your ad rank number is very important and determines how high your ad is positioned on the Google search engine results page(SERP). The old ad rank formula  in which the highest bidder won the highest spot, your maximum cost per click was the most important factor when calculating ad rank.

After Google changed the old ad rank formula in 2005 Ad Rank is calculated by the product of your  Maximum cost-per-click bid and your quality score.

`	`Ad Rank = maximum cost-per-click(maxCPC) X Quality Score(QS)

![](images/google%20ads/Aspose.Words.cfbe7e08-c68d-4c7c-a31e-21c70bb6c5e2.003.png)

From the above table Almaz Has less Max Cost-Per-Click, but due to her high quality score she has the highest Ad rank . This makes Almaz in the first position.


# **Ad Extensions And Their Benefits**

Ad extensions are extra bits of information that you can show alongside your ads. They can contain links to specific subpages on your webpage, a call button, product pricing information, and more. It expands your ad with additional information. There are many benefits you get when using ad extensions. The first one your ad takes up more real estate on the page,which is going to make it more likely to get a click,the second benefit of using google ad extension is shortcut, you can actually add site links to any page you want on your website. There are  different types of Ad Extensions such as :-

- **Sitelink Extension :** Sitelink Extensions are additional links in your ads that take people to specific pages on your website. For each campaign, you can enter up to 20 Sitelinks. By default, the Sitelinks are set at the campaign level, however, you can also set sitelinks at the ad group level. You can add up to two lines of descriptive text under each Sitelink Extension.

These enhanced Sitelink Extensions can draw attention to your ad by increasing its size. Only high-quality ads at the top of the search results page will trigger enhanced Sitelink Extensions, so make sure you add descriptions to high performing campaigns, such as your brand term campaigns. It might take some time for new campaigns to start showing Sitelinks Extensions due to the time required to build a history and quality score for the campaign.

**
` `When creating sitelinks, you want to make sure that they are relevant to the main search.

- **Callout Extension :** Callout extensions are features you can add to your Google search ads to promote your business’s unique selling points and the benefits of your products or services.Each callout extension is limited to 25 characters, and it is recommended to keep each callout text below 15 characters to maximize the number of callouts served on each ad. Each ad can show 2-6 callouts in addition to your original ad copy.

# **Conversion Tracking**

Conversion is an action that's counted when someone interacts with your ad or free product listing (for example, clicks a text ad or views a video ad) and then takes an action that you’ve defined as valuable to your business, such as an online purchase or a call to your business from a mobile phone.

Conversions are measured with conversion tracking. You can use different tracking processes to measure conversions depending on the action someone takes when they interact with your ad or free listing. Conversions can be tracked across different surfaces (such as mobile or desktop) and may include modeled conversions. Modeled conversions use data that does not identify individual users to estimate conversions that Google is unable to observe directly. This can offer a more complete report of your conversions.

When businesses track website conversions, they get a much better understanding of where customers are coming from, how customers respond to marketing, and where the sales funnel can be improved. Tracking conversions on your website will help you to:

- Understand how visitors engage with your site
- Make effective decisions about updating or changing your website
- Learn which marketing channels drive user engagement
- Measure SEO results
- Reduce customer acquisition costs
- Track ROI to more efficiently spend your [PPC](https://resultsrepeat.com/are-you-wasting-money-on-ppc-advertising/) ad campaign budget
