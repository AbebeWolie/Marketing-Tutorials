**Video**  Facebook loves when users post videos, and they even have an entire “Watch” section dedicated to video alone.This is why videos are great Facebook post ideas to improve your strategy. Create and share them often, whether they’re basic stop motion videos, informational videos, educational videos or another type altogether.

# **What Is The Difference Between Like and Follow**

When running a Facebook business page, it’s important to understand the terminology of like and follow. This gives you a deeper comprehension of who is seeing and interacting with your content. When you come across a Facebook Page that sparks your interest, you will be faced with an important decision to like or follow.

**Like** When an individual likes your page on Facebook, they automatically opt into following your page. This means that your posts will be seen in their feed and you will be listed in their ‘liked’ directory. It’s important to know that users can unfollow your page after liking your page, which means won’t see your content very often.

**Follow** Facebook users have the option to follow a page without hitting the like button. These types of followers will still see your posts in their newsfeed, but they won’t be considered a like on your page. This option was set up for people who didn’t want to befriend someone on Facebook but still wanted to see their posts.

# **Facebook Insight**

Facebook Insights is an analytics dashboard where you can track user behavior and post performance on your Facebook business page. In addition to providing key metrics like page views and post reach for paid and organic posts, the platform also recommends competitor pages to watch and track. Facebook Insights visualizes incoming data from your business page so you can learn how users are behaving on your page, what content they are engaging with, and how your page matches up to competitors.
