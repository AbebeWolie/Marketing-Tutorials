SEO stands for search engine optimization, it is the practice of increasing the quality and quantity of traffic to your website through organic search engine results. Organic trafices is any trafices coming to your website without you paying for it. The main purpose of search engine optimization is making your website ranked to the first during searching.

# **Why are search engines important?**

Imagine you are a business provider, but your website does not show up when somebody searches that related to your business  you are missing out on a ton of sales. So to overcome this problem search engines have to come to your mind. 

# **The Two Element That Makes Up An SEO Campaign:**

All SEO campaigns consist of two main elements. The first is OnPage SEO, and the second is OffPageSEO

1. OnPage SEO also called onsite SEO refers to any change you make on your website to improve its visibility . for example:-
- Updating the title tag on the page
- Changing the **<h1>** tag on page
- Editing the meta description on page

Let’s use cars as an analogy. Winning in SEO is like a car in a race. The other websites  you are competing with are like the other cars computing for race. Your OnPage SEO is the car itself, so the car’s chassis, the wheels, and the other mechanical components are basically your OnPage SEO.

1. OffPage SEO refers to any change you make off your website to improve its visibility. Some examples of OffPage SEO optimizations would be :- build a link to your website ,get your business listed on an extra directory,optimize your social profiles,and  so on. These are all actions that you implement on your website.

# **Keywords in search engine optimization** 

Keywords are simply a search phrase. For instance if somebody searches on google “ influences of technology” the keyword could be“influences of technology” that is why keywords are  search phrases. To be successful in search engine optimization  you have to understand what would be your potential customers' search in google to find your website and the product or the services you offer. Imagine you have a website for offering boot camp. One of your keywords would be “Online boot camp”. Once you know the keywords you want to target , you can optimize your website to increase your online visibility for those keywords search. 

Only Knowing the target keyword  does not make you profitable unless you have to know the keyword intent . **Keyword intent** is also known as search intent,that represents  the user’s purpose for the search.This means what is the reason for somebody when trying to search in a search engine? With what words could my potential customer get my website?

**Types of keywords**

As we discussed before, keywords are search phrases . depending on the number of words includes in the keyword they can be classified as Short Tail and Long Tail Keywords

- Short Tail keywords are general search queries, consistent of one or two words. Short tail keywords are more competitive than long tail keywords.
- Long Tail keywords are keywords that consist of three to five words. These are more targeted and much more specific. Long tail keywords are much easier to rank for in google as the typically have less competition than short tail keywords.

# **Keyword Research**

Keyword research is the process of finding good keywords to target.Keyword research is the process by which you research popular search terms people type into search engines like Google, and include them strategically in your content so that your content appears higher on a search engine results page. Keyword research is a fundamental practice in search engine optimization.

Generally, keyword research takes place in the early stages of campaigns and can provide a foundation for future projects, campaigns, or content. You can use keyword research to help you ideate around a new piece of content you’re writing, decide how to name your product features, or optimize your website or web pages after they are published. But keyword research may be different from small business to enterprise.

There are many tools that help you to find the best keyword for your website .

- Keyword Planner
- Semrush
- Mozbar  and so on….

These tools help you to find the best target keywords for your website by simple copy and paste your website link to them. They  provide a lot of information such as search volume, links, region where it was searched for etc.

# **Keyword Difficulty**

Keyword Difficulty (also known as “SEO difficulty” or “keyword competition”) is the process of evaluating how difficult it is to rank in Google's organic search results for a specific term. A keyword's difficulty is based on a number of different factors, including domain authority, page authority, and content quality. To work out keyword difficulty, there is a free chrome extension MozBar. After you add mozBar to chrome you have to sign up for a MozBar account but it is free.  Then after you sign up a mozBar account and add mozBar to your chrome, when you search a certain keyword and click mozBar it  shows the domain authority(DA) and Page Authority(PA) of the list of websites raised due to those keywords.

What is Page Authority?

Page Authority (PA) is a score developed by Moz that predicts how well a specific page will rank on search engine result pages. Page Authority scores range from one to 100, with higher scores corresponding to a greater ability to rank. It's used as a comparative metric (rather than an absolute, concrete score) when doing research in the search results and determining which pages may have more powerful or important link profiles than others. Because it's a comparative tool, there isn't necessarily a "good" or "bad" Page Authority score.

What Is Domain Authority?

Domain Authority (DA) is a metric that Moz builds tools to help improve SEO, developed to predict how well a website will rank on search engine results.DA scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to a greater probability of ranking high. Low scores indicate that your website may not show up high.Domain Authority measures the strength of entire domains or subdomains. Whereas Page Authority measures the predictive ranking strength of a single page.

Therefore based on this information you can handle the keyword difficulty caused by many competitors . 

# **What is the Importance Of Content In SEO**

Content is a compilation of information, ideas, and messages that you are going to present on your website. It is one of the best SEO strategies that helps you to gain high-quality backlinks from high quality websites. For google, high-quality backlinks indicate credibility and trust. The more quality backlink you have the higher you are likely to rank on google.

The main goal of google is providing useful and relevant results to the user. As a result, Google's algorithm analyzes millions of search results and it returns the website which it believes answers the query the best. For instance someone searches for wireless headphones, google returns websites that all talk about wireless headphones on them. So if your website is one of the few websites that have extremely high content on it, such as no spelling errors,perfect grammar,correctly formatted content,then it is most likely that google will return your website to the user, which is high ranking.

However , if your content is not well organized, has grammar errors,has mis-spelled words and incorrectly formatted google will not return your website to the user, which results in low rankings. Therefore you have to really have high quality content to stand out.


# **Things To be Avoid When You Create Content**

When you are going to create content for your website it is better avoid a massive wall of text. Because it may not attract your visitors when there is a lot of text that appears without picture,bullet points. In general your content has to be well formatted,well structured, and should include images ,and bullet points. If not, your visitors will not stay longer on your website.

It is very important to catch up with visitors who stay for a long time on your website. Unless you do this google uses  the algorithm called dwell time. The longer the person spends on your website you have good dwell time this becomes a good indication to google that what you have in your website is good. So google puts your website higher. However if  you have a low dwell time, people are not spending more time on your website. So this is a clear indicator for google that you have no good things on your website. This leads to your website being graded low by google .

# **The Three Kings That Every Website Has**

During optimization of your website, there are some key points that are more impactful. Such as:

- **Your URL**
- **Your  SEO title tag**
- **Your page title**

URL,SEO title tag, and page title essentially define what your  page is about.

**Optimizing URL** SEO friendly URLs are URLs that are designed to meet the needs of users and searchers. Specifically, URLs optimized for SEO tend to be short and keyword-rich. Search engines need a unique URL per piece of content to be able to crawl and index that content, and to refer users to it. URLs generally split into multiple distinct sections

protocol://hostname/path/filename?querystring#fragment

For example:

<https://www.betdelala.com/properties/villa.html?=7#info>

Another thing you want to know is you should avoid repeating words in URL

**Optimizing SEO title tag**  SEO title tag is the main heading text that will be seen in the google search results. A perfectly optimized SEO title balances the needs of search engines and searchers, making it both enticing to read and helpful for keyword rankings. When done right, SEO titles will help you achieve more visibility on the SERP, maximizing your number ofclicksfromsearchengines.readmore <https://raddinteractive.com/optimizing-title-tags-important-title-tag-best-practices/>

Therefore when optimizing your SEO title tag, there are some things you  have to keep in mind. Try to include single keywords in there and do not repeat words. Regardless of the length it changes often, but it is recommended not more than 60 characters.

If your website is a wordpress website there is a free wordpress  SEO  plugin called Yoast SEO that allows you to optimize your title tag. Read more about Yoast SEO wordpress plugin <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/> 

**Optimize page title** Page titles are probably the most overlooked aspects of SEO. Crafting a good page title is a must-have skill for anyone aiming for high SERP conversions. Title tags are a major factor in helping search engines understand what your page is about, they also determine the first impression visitors have of your page.

**Anchor text** are texts that refer to clickable words used to link one webpage to the another. SEO best practice dictates that anchor text should be relevant to the page you link rather than generic. Google can actually read the anchor text and they take it into consideration when ranking the website. For example if you link to a website with the anchor text “Clicks” then google is google to assume that you have a relationship with the page you link The color of these texts is usually blue as it is an actual hyperlink. 

There are different type of anchor texts such as :-

- **Exact match anchors:** is where you reference a keyword you are targeting,these are very powerful as there  is no doubt as to what that page is going to be about.
- **Partial match anchors:** This can be used in sentences such as are you looking for an online bootcamp website?online bootcamp could be clickable text. These are more natural and as a result are safer to use.
- **Branded anchors:** Branded link is when a website links to you using your brand name as anchor text. Branded anchors are great for increasing your brand presence online and supper safe.
- **Backlinks** 

# **What is Backlinks** 

To increase organic traffic and get noticed by search engines, you must invest in on-page and off-page SEO. On-page optimization is a process of creating content that helps search engines (and users) understand what your website is about. Off-site optimization is about demonstrating to search engines that your content offers value to third parties. And the most important value statement is a backlink.

Backlinks are also called inbound links because they represent another website's traffic coming to your own site. The quality and quantity of your backlinks can help you rank higher in search engines.

![](images/Seo/Aspose.Words.79d58215-552d-4756-bbc9-5e40a2f985da.005.png)

A backlink represents a vote of confidence from on site to another . Backlinks to your website are a signal to google that others vouch for your content. In short, backlinks are huge and can really push a site higher up in google. However, doing to0 much or too many backlinks can do a lot of harm for your website.This is especially true if they are low quality backlinks.

What’s the difference between a link and a backlink?

Individual documents on the web interconnect via links—they’re the glue that holds the web together. Internal links are links between web pages on the same domain, and they primarily exist to help people navigate the website. External links connect to web pages on other domains and have a wider range of possible intentions. That includes

- Provide wider context to the reader
- Support a claim made in the copy
- Cite or provide a source
- Recommend something
- Add authenticity

In each case, the link is on the page to provide additional value to the reader, so the outgoing link is a valuable asset. It’s key to understand that the link has a direction. When it’s outgoing on the linking webpage, it’s incoming to the target page. Therefore, this is a backlink to the target page.

Search engines recognize that the backlink has value and reward the target URL, interpreting the link as fully intentional; they assume there’s been some level of editorial assessment of the target webpage.That’s why backlinks that point to your website indicate to search engines that your content has value. In fact, backlinks are one of the most powerful ranking factors. They play a huge role in the success (or failure) of every website when it comes to organic search traffic.

# **How To Find Out What Backlinks Your websites have**

It's good to note that if your website is brand new,  it is highly unlikely that you will have any backlinks pointing to your website. However, if you have an aged website, so maybe your website is one year old, two years old or even older, then it's very likely that you will have some backlinks pointing to your website. As typically over time, your website will acquire backlinks naturally. So to find out what backlinks your website already has, what you need to do is head over to SEMrush(SEMrush is a SEO tool,but most of its features are paid ) and simply enter in your website URL in the top search bar within SEMrush. 

![](images/Seo/Aspose.Words.79d58215-552d-4756-bbc9-5e40a2f985da.006.png)

From the above screenshot after i have entered the “EthioClicks” URL there are some informations returned by SEMrush. Among them we can see how many backlinks there are. So in total ethioclicks.com has 509,000 different backlinks. However below it there is an information called referring to domains with a number of 930, which means that 930 different websites link to ethioclicks.com. The reason why backlinks look more than referring to a domain is because some of these websites link ethioclicks.com multiple times. However the amount of links that are in unique websites is 930.

When you click the backlink  you get a lot of backlink analysis information. Some of these backlinks are going to be, follow backlinks, and some of them are going to be no follow backlinks. follow backlinks are the ones that give you the SEO benefit. 

# **How To Determine What Makes A good Backlink**

Not all backlinks are created equally. Just because a website looks clean and shiny on the surface ,it  does not necessarily mean that having a link from that site is going to have a benefit to your website. There's a five step checklist that is used to determine if backlinks are good or not.If a website doesn't meet all five points on our criteria, then we most likely won't go ahead with it. The reason being is because SEO these days is all about quality and not quantity. The five checklists that you have to follow when  try to check the backlink is weather good or not is:

1. **Check the website's domain authority**: . Good websites will have a domain authority of at least 25, and we can easily check the website's domain authority by using the MozBar(it is a free chrome extension).
1. **Check how many keywords the website has :** Good website rank for lots of keywords. If Google allows a website to rank for a keyword, then it's a good sign that Google likes a specific website. So getting a backlink from this site is something we definitely want to do. You should look for websites that appear for at least 100 different keywords.
1. **Check the website has a decent amount of organic traffic:** It is pretty much the same logic as number two above, it all goes back to seeing if the site is good in the eyes of Google. So good websites will rank for some keywords and as a result will have some organic traffic.There isn't any perfect number you want to look out for as this number is going to vary, and it's going to be dependent on how many keywords a website appears for. However, it is recommended to look for websites that have at least 200 monthly organic visitors.
1. **Check the website has a good number of referral domains:** You have to focus on a number of referring domains, which is essentially how many unique websites are linked to this website. This is a much more reliable approach to take as it cuts out any bloated figures with the same websites linking multiple times. It is recommended to look for websites that have at least 50 referring domains, so websites that have at least 50 unique websites linking back to them.
1. **Check the page is not linking out a ton of other different websites:** Websites that link to multiple websites in the same article mean that they're going to provide a smaller SEO boost to your website as that link is going to be diluted and split across all the sites referenced.So ideally you want to get links from articles that only mention your website, and potentially one more just to keep things natural.

# **Link Building Strategy**

**Strategy 1 -  guest posing:** Guest posting or Guest blogging is when you write an article for someone else's blog. It is a great way to connect with new readers and get your name out whilst aso securing a link back to your website.

How Do You Find Guest Post Opportunities?

# **Google Search Console**

# **What Is User Experience(UX) & How To Improve  Your Website Visibility**

User experience, also known as UX, is the process design teams use to create products and layouts that provide meaningful and relevant experience to users.User experience (UX) is the subjective emotional reaction by an individual to a product, system or service. UX design takes into account all the human factors that lead to those reactions, and results in a better mobile or web experience for users.

Websites with a poor UX struggle to rank highly in search results, due to the site's poor user metrics dragging it down.There's six main things you need to be aware of that can cause a poor user experience.

1. **Responsive web design**. There are many reasons for businesses and web developers to use responsive web design principles. Content creators have an obligation to meet consumers where they are.An increasing number of users are regularly accessing the internet on a wide range of mobile devices, often more frequently than people using traditional desktop computers.  Responsive web design ensures that your content is placed correctly for all users, regardless of what device they are using.
1. **Simple navigation** Your navigation is the menu you have at the top of your website. Without website navigation, your visitors can't figure out how to find your blog, your products, your pricing, contact information, and so on and so on.What you need to remember is that people visit lots of websites every single day, so they have no shortage of places to find the information they want. If you don't offer a clear website navigation, users will get frustrated trying to find what they want, and they will simply close your website and go elsewhere.
1. **Answer search queries as soon as possible.**  A lot of websites are guilty of this. Instead of giving the user what they want, which is what they search for, they show to the user tons of other information, and then push the answers  towards the bottom of the page.This results in a poor user experience, and a lot of the time the user just gets bored.
1. **include rich media.** Rich media simply refers to images and videos. You want to add lots of images and videos on your website where relevant to help break up big walls of texts. Rich media also makes your content more visually engaging. No one wants to land on a website confronted by a massive wall of text.
1. ` `**Have a fast loading website.** You have to make sure your website loads within three seconds, as this is the number that Google has stated. You can test your website's page speed using GTmetrix, which is a free tool. More <https://gtmetrix.com>
1. **match up with search intent.**  Search intent is super important.When you optimize a page for a specific keyword, you need to make sure your page matches the search intent of that keyword.If someone searches for “Technology” in Google, then they should land on a page which is all about “Technology”.
